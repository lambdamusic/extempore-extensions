# Extempore Extensions

My custom extensions to the [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) programming environment.

## Overview

A bunch of scheme abstractions that I developed in order to create Extempore musical algorithms more efficiently and more naturally.  

Files 

* `init_midi` helpers for playing midi instruments
* `init_beats` metro+beat utils
* `init_music` utils to generate chord structures
* `init_steps` midi step sequencer 
* `init_symbols` notes symbols 
* `init_utils` lisp and scheme utils 

## How to Use

One can load them at startup like this

```
./extempore --run LOAD_ALL.xtm
```
